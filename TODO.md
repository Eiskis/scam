# Todo

- Support promises in transformMany

- [x] Dummy data
- [x] Field transformers
- [x] `created` timestamp
- [x] Relations via type
- [x] Make config and module code spearate
- [x] Rename from `scam` to something else
- [x] Publish in NPM
- [x] Sorting in lists via `sort` param
- [x] Filtering in lists via any non-reserved field param in query
- [x] Better `normalizeWhereValue`
- [x] PUT/UPDATE
- [x] DELETE
- [x] Move selection after insert/update to route handlers
- [ ] Cache in config and schema
- [ ] Allow setting type in singular in schema or use another key for setting reference
- [ ] Separate repos for demo and module
- [ ] Appropriate error codes (not 500 all the time)
- [ ] Define and document error format
- [ ] `updated` timestamp
- [ ] Make `required` work (return errors from POST and UPDATE)
- [ ] Make some kind of response formatter for success and error responses
- [ ] Document reserved words (query parameters conflicting with prop names, types conflicting with resource types)
- [x] Support nested object lists (IDs and/or expanded, singular vs. plural, using `select.all`)
- [ ] Set up test coverage
- [ ] Pagination (limits and offsets)
- [ ] Control nesting level via `depth` param (have to control circular references somehow)
- [ ] Refactor app to have more structure and less passing the same arguments everywhere
